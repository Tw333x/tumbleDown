# tumbleDown
Designed for downloading content from Tumblr, in particular the NSFW sections.

You will need a working python 2.x and some modules.

It's set up to work in Debian Linux, but will probably work with other OS's too.

modify line 31 to where you want to save files. I have it working with turd.py and so save files there.
